# Data Analyst Portfolio Repository

Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio repository! This repository showcases my skills, projects, and expertise in data analysis, including data cleaning, visualization, SQL, Python, and Power BI. Here, you'll find a collection of projects that demonstrate my ability to extract insights from data, create meaningful visualizations, and solve real-world problems.



## About the Repository
This repository is a collection of data analysis projects that highlight my technical skills and problem-solving abilities. Each project focuses on different aspects of data analysis, such as:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Data visualization using Power BI and Python libraries.
- SQL queries for data extraction and manipulation.
- Building dashboards and reports for actionable insights.

Whether you're a recruiter, a fellow data enthusiast, or someone looking to collaborate, this repository provides a comprehensive overview of my capabilities as a data analyst.
